Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Diagnosing it accurately takes many hours of careful examination by a trained pathologist. 

We decided to build an AI model using Mask-RCNN to detect, classify, and segment cells by B-cell lymphoma 6 expressions in DLBCL biopsies for faster, more consistent diagnosis.
